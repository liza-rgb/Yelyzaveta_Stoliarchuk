# Yelyzaveta_Stoliarchuk - JS Tasks

## Task №1

In this task you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

Example
filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]

## Task №2

Write a function named 'first_non_repeating_letter' that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.
For example, if given the input 'stress', the function should return 't', since the letter t only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.
As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same character, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter. For example, the input 'sTreSS' should return 'T'.
If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return an empty string ("") or None -- see sample tests.

## Task №3

Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.
Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

Examples:
digital_root(16)
=> 1 + 6
=> 7

digital_root(942)
=> 9 + 4 + 2
=> 15 ...
=> 1 + 5
=> 6

digital_root(132189)
=> 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9
=> 24 ...
=> 2 + 4
=> 6

digital_root(493193)
=> 4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3
=> 29 ...
=> 2 + 9
=> 11 ...
=> 1 + 1
=> 2

## Task №4

There is an array of numbers - arr [1, 3, 6, 2, 2, 0, 4, 5]
there is a number target = 5.
Count the number of pairs in the array, the sum of which will give target

## Task №5

Den has invited some friends. His list is:
s = "Fired:Corwill;Wilfred:Corwill;Barney:TornBull;Betty:Tornbull;Bjon:Tornbull;Raphael:Corwill;Alfred:Corwill";

Could you make a program that
· makes this string uppercase
· gives it sorted in alphabetical order by last name.
When the last names are the same, sort them by first name. Last name and first name of a guest come in the result between parentheses separated by a comma.
So the result of function meeting(s) will be:
Examples:

"(CORWILL, ALFRED)(CORWILL, FRED)(CORWILL, RAPHAEL)(CORWILL, WILFRED)(TORNBULL, BARNEY)(TORNBULL, BETTY)(TORNBULL, BJON)"

It can happen that in two distinct families with the same family name two people have the same first name too.

## Extra Task №1

Create a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next bigger number that can be formed by rearranging its digits.

Examples:
nextBigger(num: 12) // returns 21
nextBigger(num : 513) // returns 531
nextBigger(num : 2017 // returns 2071

If the digits can't be rearranged to form a bigger number, return -1

9 => -1
111 => -1
531 => -1

## Extra Task №2

Take the following IPv4 address: 128.32.10.1
This address has 4 octets where each octet is a single byte (or 8 bits).
· 1st octet 128 has the binary representation: 10000000
· 2nd octet 32 has the binary representation: 00100000
· 3rd octet 10 has the binary representation: 00001010
· 4th octet 1 has the binary representation: 00000001
So 128.32.10.1 == 10000000.00100000.00001010.00000001
Because the above IP address has 32 bits, we can represent it as the unsigned 32 bit number: 2149583361
Complete the function that takes an unsigned 32 bit number and returns a string representation of its IPv4 address.
Examples:

2149583361 => "128.32.10.1"
32 => "0.0.0.32"
0 => "0.0.0.0"
